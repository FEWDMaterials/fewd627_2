Why is it important?\n\n## Exercise 2: Adding a second page.\n---\n\nNow go ahead and add a second page to your web project.\n\nThen, **commit this new page** and **deploy once more to GitBot**.\n\n**QUESTION**: How can you access this new page in the browser?","idx":3},"html-basics":{"content":"# HTML Basics\n---\n\n**Learning objective**: Learn the basic structure of a simple HTML page.\n\n## Exercise\n---\n\nBuild me a simple resume webpage. You can make it a resume about yourself **or** it can be a fictional character from pop culture (ie: **Spiderman**). Do **not** worry about styling or generally how it looks, instead focus on how to **lay out** the information you'd like to present in order from most important to least important.\n\nAs per usual, **deploy** your project once it is completed. \n\n---\n\nHTML stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It is a set of annotations that help parsers (ie: search engines) **understand** the nature of the information that is present on the page.\n\nThink of it like an outline that describes the high level importance of different elements of your webpage.\n\n#### Basic setup\n---\n\nYour typical HTML file will look like this:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n <head>\n <!--\n the HEAD section of html does not have any content\n that the user can see\n\n instead, we place things like:\n page title\n external css links\n SEO keywords\n here\n -->\n <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n <title>My First Awesome Site</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <!--\n\n the BODY section will contain all the tags\n that the user can _SEE_ and _INTERACT_ with\n -->\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n#### Key components\n---\n\n**`<!doctype html>`**\n\nThis tag tells the browser to read our HTML content as HTML5, the latest and greatest revision of the HTML spec. We MUST include it as the first thing on our .html files. I usually type it as all lower case, but it's common practice to also type as: <!DOCTYPE html>\n\n**`<html>`**\n\nThis is the root tag. Basically, all other tags in your html file must live inside this tag. Note how on the bottom of the code snippet, we have a \"\". This is called closing a tag and we must close all tags that we open (with the exception of a few). If we do not do this, our HTML markup becomes invalid.\n\n**`<head>`**\n\nThis section contains content that does not show the user things. Typically, we would expect to see things such as the page title, external links, and SEO tags here.\n\n**`<body>`**\n\nAll the magic happens here. All the tags the user interacts with should live in this tag.\n\n#### Commonly used HTML Tags\n---\n\n```html\n<!--\n the h1 - or heading one - will have the most important text on page \n by the old guard, we should really only have one h1 per page\n -->\n <h1>Hello, Wrold</h1>\n\n <h2>This is a h2</h2>\n\n <h3>This is an h3</h3>\n\n <h4>This is an h4</h4>\n\n <h5>This is an h5</h5>\n\n <h6>This is an h6</h6> \n\n <!--\n this is an inline element\n unline the block element, which is meant to provide structure\n the inline element is interpreted as content\n this means that will appear next to one another\n -->\n <strong>This is an inline element</strong>\n <strong>This is another inline element</strong>\n\n <!-- this is a block element so it will NOT be on the same line -->\n <h1>Will this be on the same line?</h1>\n\n <!-- \n\n differences between block elements and inline elements\n block: takes up entire width of page unless otherwise told \n (we don't know how yet)\n we can impose dimensions on block elements\n inline: meant to be content or text\n we cannot impose dimensions on inline elements \n\n -->\n\n <!-- how to add more spaces or line breaks?? -->\n <h1>THIS will have many &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces</h1>\n\n <h1>This is <br> Sparta</h1>\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">Hello, Wrold I'm a link, yo</a>\n\n <!--\n this is one mode\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\"></tagName>\n\n this is a self closing tag\n <tagName attribute1=\"someValue\" attribute2=\"someOtherValue\">\n --> \n\n <!--\n convention: \n external links open up in new tab\n absolute URLs\n\n internal links open up in same tab\n relative URLs\n -->\n\n <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Hello, Wrold I'm ALSO a link, yo</a>\n\n <em>This is an em</em>\n\n <p>This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.This is a paragraph.</p>\n\n <img src=\"http://placekitten.com/g/200/300\">\n <span>This is a kitten.
